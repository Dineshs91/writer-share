## Writer share

Write. Format. Share

In a tweet you are limited to 280 characters. You also cannot format the text to your liking. 
Writer share helps you with this. 1st, you get to share your writing as an image and 2nd you can format it
with the built-in tools.

Here's an example:



## Local setup

- Clone the repository
- yarn install
- yarn dev

The app should be running and accessible at http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

The app is deployed on [Linode](linode.com).
